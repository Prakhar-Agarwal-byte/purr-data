## Overview
This document describes the work that was done under [Google Summer of Code 2021](https://summerofcode.withgoogle.com/) a.k.a. GSoC for organization Purr Data. The goal of this project was to make the Purr Data web app more usable, stable and reliable.

**Purr Data** a.k.a. **Pd-l2ork 2** is an improved version of Miller Puckette‚Äôs Pd.

[Pd](https://puredata.info/) (Pure Data) is a graphical data-flow programming environment which is geared towards real-time interactive computer music and multimedia applications. It is a full-featured open-source alternative to its commercial sibling, Cycling74‚Äôs [Max](https://cycling74.com/products/max-features).

[Purr Data](https://agraef.github.io/purr-data/) serves the same purpose, but offers a new and much improved graphical user interface and includes many 3rd party plug-ins. Like Pd, it runs on Linux, macOS and Windows, and is open-source throughout.

You can try the latest version from https://purrdata.glitch.me/

## Work Done
### - Making shortcuts work depending on the device platform (macOS, Windows, Linux)
Made the shortcuts on the web app work the same way as on the desktop app depending upon
the device platform. Some shortcuts were reserved by the browser so alternate shortcut keys
were assigned to them in web app.

Fixed shortcuts when creating objects
### - Improving the file manager so files/folders can be added/renamed/deleted
Added the renaming and deleting of files feature, so that user can conveniently do these
operations directly from the files list in the sidebar.
### - Improving the layout of menu and patch windows for better user experience
Made the canvases rearrangeable by dragging its top bar, added close button in canvas itself,
improved scrollbar appearance, replaced the view options from global menu bar with shortcut
keys. Added spinning refresh icon to file list and improved console, sidebar animation, added
separate scrolling of each canvas.

Sidebar shows when appropriate action is performed. Added shadows and round borders to
menus. Fixed menu hiding behind other elements and not closing on mouse click. Added copy
feature in console, implemented tooltip feature.

Added traversing feature to console search matches and improved marks by changing the
highlight all mark colors, padding. Added open only supported file type feature.
### - Fixing many small bugs to make the app more stable and usable
Redesigned Preferences, Properties, Array options, etc. to show in separate dialogs instead of
sidebar. Also added dialog for sending messages to Pd/Canvas. Removed Web MIDI error alert
on startup in unsupported browsers.

Fixed loading modal getting stuck on startup sometimes. Fixed wrong mouse coordinates
issues that happened in some situations. Improved initial loading of web app. Added collapsible
and scrollable sidebar, changed ‚Äúnull‚Äù to blank in shortcuts. Fixed app stalling on clicking ‚ÄúAbout
Pd-L2ork‚Äù menu option.
